Compiled ExileAPI
==================

It is highly recommended that you use the [limited user method explained here](https://www.ownedcore.com/forums/mmo/path-of-exile/poe-bots-programs/676345-run-poe-limited-user.html).

This reads the memory of the Path of Exile client application and displays it on transparent overlay.
